# PKI Management with Puppet

All of the OpenSSL work is currently done by the tools provided in EasyRSA from
the OpenVPN 2.2.2 source, with the intention that some will be replaced by
calling the OpenSSL commands directly.

This is still very much an experiment, but I would like to be able to manage
keys associated with each of these CAs and start deploying certificates for
things like VPNs, MCollective, and Nginx vHosts using intermediate CAs.  Some
of the CAs, like the example for Puppet below will not manage keys directly,
but simply prepare the environment so that you do have a true chain of trust.
Obviously this is of little use to you unless you install the RootCA
certificate yourself.  Luckily, we have puppet.

## Usage

### Generate the Root CA

    $pki_dir = "/Users/zach/devel/pki"

    pki::ca { "Root":
      pki_dir     => $pki_dir,
      key_email    => "ssl@example.com",
      key_size     => 2048,
      key_country  => "US",
      key_province => "OR",
      key_city     => "Portland",
      key_org      => "ZTel",
      dh           => false,
    }

### Generate the Intermediate CAs

So far, this builds a certificate/key pair for each `pki::interca` specified and signs them with the RootCA, specified at the location `rootca`.

Set resource defaults for a simpler manifest:

    Pki::Interca { 
      pki_dir      => $pki_dir,
      rootca       => "${pki_dir}/Root",
      key_email    => "ssl@example.com",
      key_size     => 2048,
      key_country  => "US",
      key_province => "OR",
      key_city     => "Portland",
      key_org      => "TestCo",
      require      => Pki::Ca["Root"],
    }

Provide the resources to generate the intermediate CAs:

    pki::interca { "VPN":
      dh => true,
    }
    pki::interca { "MCollective": 
    }
    pki::interca { "Puppet": 
    }
    pki::interca { "TechOps": 
      key_email    => "techops@example.com",
      key_name     => "TechOps",
    }
